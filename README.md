ABOUT
=====

libstm32pp is a template peripheral library for the STM32F1/STM32F2/STM32F4
family of microcontrollers(uC).

This library is written in C++, and uses heavily template metaprogramming,
statics assertions, templates and enumerators.

All these features provide a memory efficient implementation, compile-time
error-checking and strong typing.

INSTALLATION AND USE
====================

There is no installation, this is a header file only library.

To use this library, simply link the libstm32pp/include folder to your source.

The following files are important:

+ device_select.hpp     Here the microcontroller family must be selected.
                        (uncomment the family you are going to use)

+ clock.hpp             Here the uC clocks can be configured.
                        (be sure to call clk::initialize() as soon as possible
                         in your program)
                         
+ interrupt_cpp.hpp     This is actually a source file that configures the uC
                        interrupts.
                        (include this file in a source file .cpp)
                        
+ system_call_cpp.hpp   This is actually a source file that implements the
                        newlib hardware dependant functions.
                        (include this file in a source file .cpp)

Check the "demo" folder for examples.

An editor with auto-complete feature is highly recommended for development using
this library.

If you need an open source framework for development of these families of uCs, 
you should check the bareCortexM project:

(https://github.com/JorgeAparicio/bareCortexM)

It's a framework based on the Eclipse IDE and the GCC toolchain, for bare metal
development of Cortex™ M Series processors.
